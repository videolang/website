Welcome to the Video Blog. This blog is for Video release

to Video and video editing in general.

Currently, as of this post's creation, the latest version of Video is v0.1.
This version requires [MLT][mlt] which is not included. You can find it on the
[download page][download]. Alpha builds of v0.2 are nearly ready. The major
update with this version is the removal of MLT as a dependency. Instead, Video
will rely entirely on [FFmpeg][ffmpeg], which will also be pre-bundled with the
Mac and Windows builds of Video. Check out the [Github Project Page][source] if
you want to check out the current progress, report any issues, or contribute.
